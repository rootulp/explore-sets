[![License](https://img.shields.io/:license-mit-blue.svg)](https://rootulp.mit-license.org)

A small app to explore sets. Inspired by [tokensets.com/explore](https://www.tokensets.com/explore).

Built with [next.js](https://nextjs.org/), [set.js](https://github.com/SetProtocol/set.js), [ethers](https://docs.ethers.io/v5/).

## To-do

- [] Create Next.js app
- [ ] Convert it to TypeScript
- [ ] Set up an Alchemy project
- [ ] Configure an Ethers provider
- [ ] Read basic Set info from Set.js
- [ ] Create a page for all Set cards. Possible URL path `/set`
- [ ] Populate cards
- [ ] Style cards in a 3 x 1 grid
- [ ] Add a network selector to switch between mainnet and Kovan

## Extra credit
- [ ] Set detail page. Possible URL path `/set/[:symbol]`
- [ ] List streaming fee on Set detail page
- [ ] Surface price of Set token using CoinGecko API. Consider using [useDapp.useCoingeckoPrice](https://usedapp.readthedocs.io/en/latest/coingecko.html#hooks)
